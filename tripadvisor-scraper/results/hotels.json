We very much enjoyed the aperitif offered on the terrace. I was sorry, however, to note that sometimes the customer is considered only as a tourist. Not being able to access the starred restaurant on the terrace (it does not accept children) we had dinner, on their advice, in the one on the beach / solarium. Spectacular view, bad food, to pass on to the typical tourist. Having to leave very early we were offered the possibility, first, of a takeaway breakfast (since we had paid for it with the room), then, of something quick to consume at the counter (a coffee and some croissants). Result: no coffee (machine in the breakfast room still off) a plate with mini croissants and leftover cake from the day before that, of course, we refused. Fortunately, a nespresso machine with pods was available in the room. Unable to book a Bolt taxi from our phone, we ask the reception to do it for us the night before, so we don't have problems early in the morning. A taxi arrives without signs, without a taximeter, with a driver who does not remember where he must take us and to whom we must give directions. In the end he asks us 28€, against the 10€ paid on the way (Bolt would have asked 8€ for the same route). I hope you can improve these aspects and be in every way the 4 stars you expect.",

      "text": "The hotel has a nice lobby, but this is just a facade. The room was furnished with what looked like the cheapest office furniture they could find. Our room was dark and a bit on the damp side. While it did have an A/C controller, it didn't actually do anything. During meal times the room also filled with the smell of whatever is being cooked.\nAs the hotel butts up against the adjacent building you have a lovely view into someone's home, (the alternative being a room on the front which suffers from high noise volumes and dirt from the construction site opposite). No sunlight penetrates the room and you need to go outside and look up to see if it's a sunny day.\nStaff were cheerful and pleasant, but with a few exceptions (concierge guy was very good) generally useless. One example of manyeach day we asked: Can I have some normal tea in my room as the cleaner only leaves flavoured bags each day? Each day the answer was: Yes, no problem sir, we'll bring some up. Each day nothing arrived \nThe rooftop bar/pool area is very noisy from the construction site and rather small and the beach club down the hill and across the main road is also next to a construction site. \nAll round this is a very disappointing hotel seeking maximum payments for minimum service and standards. To give you an idea, this is one or may even two levels down from a Premier Inn",

      "title": "Underwhelming!! Stay elsewhere!",
      "text": "I’m not sure where to begin… So the Hotel is situated opposite a building site for context. \n\nUpon arrival you are met with friendliness and the reception area is modern and well kept. However, our room was not ready and there was no where to wait so we were sent away for 6 hours. After getting up at 3am all we wanted to do was relax but we couldn’t. Not ideal.\n\nWe had booked what they call a Deluxe Room and for that you get from what I can see a Standard/Premier Room but on a high floor. See photos of said Deluxe Room. This is anything but Deluxe! Very basic, only a rail to hang your clothes, no chest of drawers. Very very basic! Bathroom ok but run down.  Bed hard. Shower weak. \n\nWe were woken up daily by workmen doing their work right opposite us. Work being a complete build so a lot of noise ! Zero privacy. Zero point in even having a balcony. See photos for the view!\n\nYou have to reserve your spot on the very small paddling pool on the roof. Very comfy sun loungers but dirty glass around the pool, oh and a bright red crane right over your head as you try to relax. \n\nWe tried the breakfast, it was good and a lot of choice. We also had treatments which were good. The people in the spa are lovely. It’s because of them I’ve given an extra star.\n\nWe had a late flight home and like in normal hotels we asked for late check out. Firstly they told me I had to wait till the night before we check out to find out if it’s possible but would be €60. We then enquired and were told the hotel was full. A lie. I checked other sites and there was availability. We were not asking to stay in our room particularly but have somewhere to freshen up before our late flight. We were then told there were rooms but we would have to pay €150. The reception team were very unhelpful but offered to keep our luggage so we had no choice but to wander - again for 6 hours waiting for our pick up. Pool was full. No where to shower or wait. Another long day ahead.\n\nDuring our stay we decided to go to the bar and have a cocktail. We ordered them and there was zero alcohol in the drink! I mentioned this to the bar man who was very offended and reluctantly put a little more in the glass. He also told me they only put 10ml of drink in the cocktail when the standard is much more. A bit of a rip off if you ask me.\n\nWe were looking forward to seeing the pool by the sea. Well this is not by the hotel. It’s a walk down the hill and along the seafront. Another run down area next to some rocks that they call a private beach. \n\nOver all I do not recommend this Hotel. Our little trip was to relax and our experience here was not that. It looks fabulous and lovely in the pictures but it’s not. Ok the reception area is well kept but our room was not and the staff could be vastly improved.\n\nThere are definitely nicer hotels in Malta and I’m sure are run by people who believe in good service when this hotel did very little.\n\nI would say look elsewhere.",

      "text": "We stayed at 1926 for a week over the Easter break, Malta was lovely and we were really lucky with the weather!\n\nLocation wise the hotel is a short walk from the shops, restaurants and bars in Sliema and also the ferry to Valletta or other day trips, we even strolled up to St Julian’s too. The hotel were really helpful with everything we needed.\n\nRoom was great and yes there is construction but generally there’s no getting away from it in Malta and didn’t find it bothered us. Being lucky with the weather they did open up the beach club which was a short walk away which provided towels etc and id ideal as there are few sandy beaches. \n\nThe rooftop pool was also open which had a heated pool, note you have to book this on the app when you arrive as only few spaces but was well worth it and the food was amazing! \n\nMy biggest feedback was not being able to book the spa (like you can the rooftop) it’s not very big at all and the evening we went it was just full of families with young kids splashing in the pool, even messing about in the steam and sauna and this was just really disappointing/not relaxing and so we avoided it for the rest of the week. \n\nReally handy having the usual luggage store and then you can change in the spa changing rooms / freshen up before travelling.

      "text": "We booked 1926 Le Soleil spontaneously while already in Malta and unfortunately encountered a bit of a booking issue at the beginning. However, this was resolved in the most professional and heartfelt way by the hotel manager, Olga, whom we would like to especially commend. Thanks to her, we received a fantastic upgrade to the “Sunny Suite” with a corner balcony and beautiful sea view – truly one of the highlights of our trip.\n\nThe hotel itself is full of thoughtful features: the rooftop pool with heated water and the most comfortable loungers we’ve ever experienced offered true relaxation. The indoor pool, sauna, steam bath, and modern gym provide a top-level wellness experience.\n\nThe in-house restaurant “Margaux” is also highly recommended – the food is delicious, especially the steaks, and the prices are very fair for the quality offered.\n\nA minor downside was that the air conditioning was still on winter mode during our stay in April. Since opening the windows brings in mosquitoes (which can lead to restless nights), we were provided with a state-of-the-art fan, which worked perfectly – an innovative and effective solution.\n\nThe staff throughout the hotel were extremely friendly, attentive, and always happy to help – we truly felt welcomed and well taken care of.\n\nThe location is also ideal: right by the Tigné Point promenade, close to shopping and with easy access to the ferry to Valletta – great for both exploring and relaxing.\n\nAll in all, we had a wonderful and memorable holiday full of comfort, good food, and amazing service. We’ll definitely be back!",

The hotel is located in a position set back from the sea, the photos of the beach club suggest it is facing the sea, instead it is located in a narrow alley a few minutes walk from the sea. The main flaw, incorrectly not reported on the hotel website, is that close to the structure there is a very noisy construction site in full swing (Saturday and Sunday included), so forget about a good sleep and privacy. The structure is quite modern, small rooms and not soundproofed, so beyond the yard you hear the noise of the other rooms, the corridor, etc .. I point out that the hotel bar closes at 11pm, and even if you are sitting down to drink a cocktail you turn off the lights:-) , just to invite you to go to sleep. I confirm, like other reviews, that the breakfast is high quality, machines to serve with Lavazza coffee, good choice of sweet and savory, fresh juice, fruit, yogurt. Beautiful rooftop terrace with a small sea view pool and restaurant (not tried). Overall I was not convinced, I would not go back.",

They even welcomed me with a glass of champagne on arrival, which was such a lovely touch.\n\nOne of the best things is the free daily tours and activities organised by the staff. They really get creative with these! I did a local food tour and a yoga session—both were brilliant. Just a tip: these are first-come, first-serve, so book as soon as you see them. Sometimes, they’ll even throw in spa vouchers or discounts if you join in.\n\nThe hotel app was a game-changer. I could book spa treatments, request room service, and even message the front desk from wherever I was. It’s super handy if you’re out and about and need advice or help. They’ll help you set it up when you arrive.\n\nThe location is perfect for a solo traveller—just five minutes’ walk to the Valletta ferry on one side and loads of restaurants and shopping on the other. The spa area is great too, with a sauna, steam room, and heated chairs that I could have relaxed on all day. The beach club was also a lovely spot to unwind.\n\nI didn’t try the rooftop pool or the restaurant, but everything I did experience was spot on.

We absolutely cannot fault the kindness and helpfulness of the staff. \n\nThe second best thing is the rooftop pool (La Terrasse) - such a luxury to be able to nip up to the 12th floor and be poolside. It's not huge but it's enough to cool off and swim a couple of lengths. The view across the ocean on one side and across Sliema the other side is wonderful. The sunbeds are more like sofas - large and comfy. There are 14 so it's not massive but we didn't struggle for a bed. It's over 16s only so no young children around this pool. There are also gazebos with two sunbeds in each which feels decadent, though they're not poolside. The staff will provide you with a towel which is large and comfy. You can order drinks and food there too. We highly recommend the flatbreads and ciabatta - big portions and delicious!\n\nThe rooftop pool is in addition to the beach club (La Plage). There is a little walk to this but only a couple of minutes as it's right on the seafront. It's not often that a place looks as good in reality as it does on the photos but the infinity pool is genuinely that stunning. Prepare for sand under your feet though as you swim! There is a bar and they do a Happy Hour with 2 for 1 on cocktails. \n\nThe room was very good - we had a superior room. The bed was absolutely massive and very comfortable. The room was stylish though quite dark in an evening with only a few lamps. We had to use our phone torches to give enough lighting for doing make up for example. The room has air conditioning, though this doesn't extend to the bathroom. The room was spotlessly clean and housekeeping were very thorough. The room has two small balconies - neither big enough for us to sit out on but enough for drying swimming costumes over the fold-up chair! \n\nEverything is operated through an app which you download when you check in - including your room \"key\" code. Very useful and modern. The app includes opening times for the restaurants, pools, spa and gym facilities, etc. It also includes offers of free trips/tours/events so well worth exploring it when you arrive. It includes a chat service to message reception which we found helpful. \n\nThere is a lot of construction work happening in Sliema at the moment so unfortunately it was very noisy with constant banging and drilling from 8am. This is not a fault with the hotel though - I am certain you would hear it anywhere you stayed in Sliema. The staff here have been so helpful, I feel like they'd have tried to cancel all construction work for the duration of our stay if we mentioned it! But it is something to bear in mind. The view from both balconies - on two different sides of the hotel - were of apartment blocks actively being built/rebuilt and restored. \n\nThe hotel is located halfway between each side of the peninsula so it was an easy walk to either sea front. It was also easy to get to the ferries, shopping centre and lots of bars/restaurants. \n\nAll in all we loved it here and would recommend this hotel for couples. I wouldn't recommend it as a family hotel, as there are likely to be other places better aimed at families and catering better for children. It is a wonderful hotel though for people who want a lovely relaxed break in a bustling area of Malta. ",

From eco-friendly initiatives to thoughtful environmental practices, their dedication to ecological responsibility was truly impressive. \nI would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a relaxing, responsible, and memorable stay.",

      "text": "This review is late, but very very needed. \n\nI LOVE THIS HOTEL... I don't care what any other review says, this is the best hotel in Malta, in fact, when I come back I will only stay at 1926. From the second I arrived to the airport I was greeted with such hospitality by my driver who picked me and took me to the hotel. When I checked in I met Christian and Alex who were both so warm and welcoming. I was in love with the vibe of the hotel  from the second I walked in -- the glass of prosseco also didn't hurt. I was really happy when I checked in as they gave me a free upgrade to one of their suites which was fit for a queen. This hotel is beyond amazing, they offer FREE tours and shuttles for all guest, every day, and had a beautiful turn down service every night. I came in decemebr so the beach club was closed, but the spa pool and sauna honestly made me not miss it. \n\nOne of my favorite parts of this hotel is the fine dining restaurant they have on the top floor, somiler Bryan was so amazing and knowledgable on his wines that it changed how I drink wine. And the chef and his team, the food was outstanding, I did the chef's course with the wine paring.. i don't remember nor care how much it costs, the experience was well worth the value. \n\nI cannot talk about this place without mentioning some of the managers and \"executives\" of the place, especially Sascha the COO who I met with another exect [sorry I did not catch her name] on my last night during their canapie night. Typically when you meet these type of people they are very stush and closed off. But its truly not the case with this team, while I am sure I talked their ear off, they were all so friendly and hosptiable. \n\nI love this hotel so much, that it has been almost 2 months and I still have the app on my phone, and cannot get myself to delete it. I was sad when I checked out of this place, as it quickly became my home in Matla. \n\nI absolutely love this hotel.\n\nPS. i know there were some comments about the construction outside, but the island has been in construction for 20 years. There were some workers outside of my window, and I didn't find them disturbing one bit. In fact, I enjoyed waving to them in the mornings as I sat for my morning tea. The noise was very low and I often didn't hear them. Plus if you are visiting Malta, you should be outside not inside ... so the construction shouldn't both you one bit. \n\nAgain, I love this place and look forward to booking my next stay upon my next visit to Malta.",

      "text": "Stayed at this hotel for 5 nights in December.\nIt is low season, so you can find free parking on the street (the hotel does not have parking) without much problem, but in high summer season it can be a real headache.\nUpon check-in we were given a free upgrade to a better room, but being two beds (instead of a King), the next day we asked if it was possible and the available one was without that upgrade (we lost it because of the request made).\nAs for the new room, for two days we had problems with the door, as they use not a key but a code and our system did not work. Maintenance had to intervene. It was more cumbersome for the people at Reception who had to open up to us every time than for us, really.\nThe Wifi works very well and the speed is good.\nAs for breakfast, it is all very delicious, but I do not find it acceptable that whatever is a cooking dish (for example tortilla) has a supplement of 7 €. Quite a lot is the amount already paid.\nAs for the SPA, it is comfortable, quiet and with good temperature. However, quite a few of the jets do not work. Buttons are pressed and nothing happens.",

      "text": "I feel very disappointed after staying here for 3 nights and I can completely agree with the others who state that they have been mislead. The hotel is not on the seafront, not like the pictures advertised of the beach club. The hotel entrance is down a side street a few streets back from the sea front. \nThe room we had was upgraded to a superior double. I would have expected a normal double to be of this size and standard in a 4 star hotel. It was basic however, on the plus side, the bed was big and comfy. The room was cleaned daily and we got fresh towels when we requested them.\nThere was a selection of items at breakfast - cooked and continental which were regularly topped up. The orange juice was fresh and they had a selection of fresh fruit too.\nThe bar served a large selection of premium drinks and the cocktails looked nice and good value with a happy hour. \nThere was building work going on outside the hotel which was noisy but I think it could have been worse if we were on a lower level floor. \nThe spa was a big let down, there was about 4 loungers and a few hard chairs. There was only one jet in the hydro pool which worked as the other two were broken. The sauna and steam room were small but adequate. The whole spa needs a massive revamp, it looks a bit grubby especially around the pool area. \nDon’t believe the reviews about Prosecco on arrival as the hotel does not offer this.\nThe location of the hotel is good for catching the ferry to Valletta but overall, I think there is other hotels in the area which are more premium class for around the same price.",

The “junior suite” turned out to be just a standard, basic room—nothing “suite” about it.\n\nWe dined at Restaurant Margaux and honestly, the food was utterly mediocre. \n\nThe so-called spa? Don’t be fooled. It’s just a pool—no functioning jets, no hot tub, and the steam room wasn’t working properly either.\n\nTo top it all off, the hotel claims the key code access system is “convenient”—ours worked once during the entire stay. We had to share a single physical key between us, which had the room number written on the key chain. Seriously unsafe if you happen to misplace it.\n\nAll in all, poor communication, false advertising, and a total lack of value for the money. Would not recommend.",

The noise levels are obscene. We have never stayed in hotels with such thin walls. We could hear every phone call, every step in rooms above us, and even so much as the toilets flushing in the room next door. We were also placed next to the lift (409) and had constant noise from this to add to it. In addition, there is awful building works going on across the road (less than 10m away). This was obscenely loud and went on from very early on until fairly late. So, you have constant noise. We raised this and was told the manager would contact us “if there was an issue that existed”, but never said anything. This is poor as there is no way they are unaware of the issues. Other guests also complained about the same thing. \nTherefore, despite the lovely amenities, I would absolutely NOT reccomend staying in this hotel because of the noise and the poor way management dealt with it. Had we been booked in for longer, we likely would’ve cancelled this.",
