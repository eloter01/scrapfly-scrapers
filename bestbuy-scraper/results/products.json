So, you should ask about that to see if it works for your situation.\n\nSide note: I got this MBA before the new MBP M3s were out.

You can do this from your device or you can go to an Apple Store and add it in store, you'll just need your device added to Find My so they can pull your serial number. You do not have to have the device with you. \n\nYou have the option of purchasing - Monthly, Yearly, or 3 Years. The 3 year option saves you around $30.  Apple Care is available to extend after the it expires but only for a limited time. \n\nI would suggest getting apple care on these larger investment devices. Just in case something happens you'll know that you won't be paying the retail price to replace it IF even at all.",

The M3 Pro chip handles intensive workflows effortlessly: video editing, coding, multitasking—no lag, no compromise. The 18GB RAM strikes a perfect balance for high-efficiency use without overpaying for surplus. 512GB storage is fast and sufficient if you manage files properly or use external drives.\n\nThe black finish is a statement—minimal, bold, professional. Display is sharp, bright, color-accurate. Battery life sustains full workdays under real load. Keyboard and trackpad remain best-in-class. Thermal management is silent and effective.\n\nThis machine is not for casual users. It’s for those who demand precision and reliability. If you need power in a sleek frame, this model executes flawlessly.",

        "title": "But Battery Life Falls Short",
        "text": "After using my MacBook intensively for the past 9 months, I can confidently say that it delivers a premium experience in most aspects. The standout feature is, without a doubt, the display. The Retina screen offers exceptional resolution, sharpness, and color accuracy, making it ideal not only for everyday tasks but also for professional creative work. The brightness level is sufficient even under direct sunlight, and True Tone technology helps reduce eye strain in various lighting conditions.\n\nFrom a performance standpoint, the MacBook runs remarkably well. The seamless integration between macOS and the hardware ensures fluid multitasking, rapid app launches, and a generally silent operation. Especially if equipped with Apple’s M-series chip, the system demonstrates impressive processing power and energy efficiency.\n\nHowever, one area where the device slightly underdelivers is battery life. In typical daily usage — with Wi-Fi on, moderate brightness, and standard apps like browsers and productivity tools — I’ve consistently gotten around 9 to 10 hours on a full charge. While Apple advertises longer runtimes, these figures are hard to reach in real-world conditions. This could be a limitation for users who rely on long unplugged sessions.\n\nIn summary, based on 9 months of hands-on experience, this MacBook excels with its outstanding display, smooth performance, and sleek design, though its battery life might disappoint power users. Still, it remains a top choice for those prioritizing screen quality, portability, and system stability.",

        "text": "Ugh, where do I even begin with the absolute nightmare that is Best Buy's \"Geek Squad\" and their shady refurbished practices? Let me tell you, steer clear unless you enjoy throwing your money and precious time down the drain. I purchased what I thought was a \"certified refurbished\" laptop from them a few months ago, trusting their reputation (clearly a mistake on my part). Fast forward a few weeks, and the thing starts acting wonky – freezing, crashing, the whole nine yards. So, I dutifully book an appointment with the Geek Squad, which involved driving for hours because the nearest available slot was miles away. Strike one: wasted time and gas. I finally get to the store, lug the problematic laptop in, and explain the issues. They take it in, and after what felt like an eternity, I get a call saying I somehow damaged the laptop and that it would cost me another five hundred dollars to fix it! Are you kidding me?! I treated that laptop like it was made of glass. There was absolutely no damage on my end. It's infuriating to be falsely accused like that, especially when I suspect they pawned off a lemon on me in the first place.\nIt just adds insult to injury, doesn't it? To think, after being a loyal card member for over two decades – all that money spent, those extended warranties they always push, the accessories you probably never even opened – and this is how they treat you. It's like they see loyalty as an opportunity to take advantage, knowing you're more likely to trust them. So, there I was, stuck between a rock and a hard place. They wouldn't honor any kind of warranty on their so-called \"refurbished\" product, and they were essentially holding my laptop hostage unless I coughed up an exorbitant amount of money for repairs I didn't cause. Another wasted trip back to the store, more wasted time arguing with people who clearly couldn't care less about customer satisfaction.\nAnd you're absolutely right to bring up those other reviews. It's not just a one-off incident; it sounds like a pattern. The fact that other customers are reporting the exact same issue with the screen failing and then being blamed for it is incredibly damning. It points to a systemic problem with their refurbished products and a complete lack of accountability. They're clearly selling faulty merchandise and then trying to squeeze even more money out of unsuspecting customers by pinning the damage on them. It makes you wonder how many others have been through this same frustrating and expensive ordeal. It's not just about the money either; it's the principle of it. You trusted them, you invested in their products and services, and they repay your loyalty with accusations and a hefty repair bill for something that was likely their fault from the start. It's a slap in the face, frankly. This whole experience has been a colossal waste of time, money, and energy. Best Buy's business practice of selling questionable refurbished goods, refusing to stand by them, and then shamelessly blaming the customer is utterly unacceptable. Do yourself a favor and take your business elsewhere. You'll save yourself a massive headache and a significant chunk of your hard-earned cash. Consider this my loudest possible warning: AVOID BEST BUY FOR REFURBISHED GOODS AT ALL COSTS! Twenty years of being a card member, and for what? Absolutely nothing but aggravation and a broken laptop they refuse to take responsibility for.",

When it works it works perfectly. I am so busy between school and work I don’t have time to take it in to be looked at and I’m too afraid it will have to be exchanged and I end up without a laptop while being in school and I fall behind. I am making it work and don’t want to pay full price as the only thing I do on my computer is literally school work and nothing else.\n\nI love the screen size and the light up key board.

        "title": "Fast, beautiful MacBook Pro",
        "text": "Bought this for my daughter, who is taking digital creative courses at a local community college. This is a stunning Macbook Pro. We wanted silver, but only space gray was available. It is sleeker and (dare I say) prettier in person than we expected. The 16\" screen is impressive and gorgeous.\n\nWe own several Apple devices but have chosen not to upgrade to the M-chip series in the Pro yet, as this version is more affordable and runs the same macOS as the latest MacBook Pro. She uses Adobe and Final Cut on this model without any delays.\n\nThe refurbished model is nearly perfect. One tiny (I won't even call it a dent) blemish on one edge is the only giveaway that it's not brand new. The battery life might also be less than perfect, but adding a new battery is fairly inexpensive. I believe this 2019 model will last at least three years before it starts to lag in the market. That's perfect timing for us to upgrade to an M-chip in the future. \n\nThe box it came in was a little \"handled,\" but the laptop was safely bubble-wrapped inside. We had it delivered to our local Best Buy and picked it up from there to avoid having to be home to sign for it. We also thought it might improve the package status to go to the store and not out for residential delivery.\n\nI'm thrilled to have scored a high-end MacBook Pro for just a quarter of its original price. I also treated myself to an M3 MacBook Air in Midnight at a discount (since it's no longer the latest model), and it’s stunning as well!",
